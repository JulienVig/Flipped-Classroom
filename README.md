Early predictors of student success are becoming a key toolin flipped and online courses to ensure that no student is leftbehind along course activities.  However, with an increasedinterest in this area, it has become hard to keep track of whatthe state of the art in early success prediction is.  Moreover,prior work on early success prediction based on clickstreamshas mostly focused on implementing features and models fora specific online course (e.g.,  a MOOC). It remains there-fore under-explored how different features and models enableearly predictions, based on the domain, structure, and edu-cational setting of a given course.  In this paper, we reportthe results of a systematic analysis of early success predic-tors for both flipped and online courses.  In the first part, wefocus on a specific flipped course. Specifically, we investigateeight feature sets, presented at top-level educational venuesover the last few years, and a novel feature set proposed inthis paper and tailored to this setting.  We benchmark theperformance of these feature sets using a RF classifier, andwe provide and discuss an ensemble feature set optimized forthe target flipped course.  In the second part, we extend ouranalysis to courses with different educational settings (i.e.,MOOCs),  domains,  and  structure.   Our  results  show  that(i) the ensemble of optimal features varies depending on thecourse setting and structure, and (ii) the predictive perfor-mance of the optimal ensemble feature set highly dependson the course activities.

## Requirements

The code has been tested under Python >= 3.6. 

Install dependencies:

```setup
git clone https://github.com/d-vet-ml4ed/flipped-classroom.git
cd flipped-classroom
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We recommend set ```PYTHONPATH``` before running the code:
```
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:`pwd`
```

## Data Preparation

By default, course grades, problem events, video events, and course schedules are expected to be stored in ```./data/course/{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{courseplatform}```.

```
mkdir -p data/course/{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{courseplatform}/grade
mkdir -p data/course/{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{courseplatform}/problem_event
mkdir -p data/course/{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{courseplatform}/video_event
mkdir -p data/course/{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{courseplatform}/schedule
```

In the folder ```data/course/{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{courseplatform}```, we expect that a file named ```metadata.csv``` [format: course_id,title,teachers,period,start_date,end_date,weeks,grade_thr,grade_max] includes the main descriptive attributes of the courses.

For each course, we expect that the following data is provided in the corresponding subfolders below:
- ```grade/{course_id}.csv``` [format: user_id, grade, date].
- ```problem_event/{course_id}.csv``` [format: user_id,problem_id,event_type,timestamp,problem_type,grade,submission_number].
- ```video_event/{course_id}.csv``` [format: user_id,video_id,event_type,timestamp,seek_type,old_time,current_time,new_time,old_speed,new_speed].
- ```schedule/{course_id}.csv``` [format: id,type,chapter,subchapter,date,duration,grade_max].

## Feature Extraction

To extract a set of features for a course, run this command:

```train
python routine/compute_feature_set.py 
    --model "extractor.set.marras_et_al.MarrasEtAl" 
    --courses "{flipped-classroom|mooc}/{course_id}"
    --timeframe "lq-week"
    --workdir "../data/result/edm21/feature/"
```

By default, features are expected to be stored in ```./data/result/edm21/feature/```. 

Each course feature set is saved in a folder named as ```lq-week-{feature_set}-{course_id}```.

For each feature set, in the above folder, the following files are stored:
- feature_labels.csv [format: user_index,label-grade,label-pass-fail,label-dropout,label-stopout]
- feature_values.npz [shape: (no_users, no_weeks, no_features)]
- settings.txt

## Training and Evaluation

To train and evaluate a predictor on a set of features, run this command:

```train
python routine/train_predictor.py 
    --predictor "random_forest"
    --target_col "label-pass-fail"
    --feature_set "lq_week-{feature_set}-{course_id}"
    --workdir "../data/result/edm21/"
    --folds 10
```

By default, models and evaluations are expected to be stored in ```./data/result/edm21/```. 

Each predictor is saved in a folder named as ```lq-week-{course_id}-{target_col}-{model}-{feature_set}-{aggregation_type}```.

For each predictor, in the above folder, the following files are stored:
- params.txt
- predictor-w{week_id}-f{fold_id}.h5 files
- stats.csv [format: week,fold,y_train_idx,y_test_idx,auc,bal_acc,f1,acc_fail,acc_pass,bthr,ypred_proba,ypred,ytrue]
