# Predicting success from MOOC behavioral patterns

Over years at EPFL, first year students volunteered to participate to the Linear Algebra flipped classroom. In this experimental course, teaching alternates between traditional ex cathedra lectures and flipped classroom. During flipped classroom, students start at home by watching videos from a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) and by practicing on simple exercises. In class, the teacher can therefore focus directly on the more complex exercises.
By analyzing the data collected from the MOOC, such as speed change, fast forward or when students watch the videos, we want to predict how students will perform and identify behavioral patterns correlated to success.
