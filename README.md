## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To prepare data:



## Feature Extraction

To extract a setof features for a course, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

## Training and Evaluation

To train and evaluate a predictor on a set of features, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

## Contributing 

This code is provided for educational purposes and aims to facilitate reproduction of our results, and further research 
in this direction. We have done our best to document, refactor, and test the code before publication.

If you find any bugs or would like to contribute new models, training protocols, etc, please let us know.

Please feel free to file issues and pull requests on the repo and we will address them as we can.
